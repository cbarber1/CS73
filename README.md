# CS73 Homework Assignments

## HW 2 Notes

In total it took me about 2 and a half hours. Code was pretty easy, so most of the time was just spent either picking colors or brainstorming ideas for how to convey emotions with simple shapes. Probably could have spent more time brainstorming clever ideas to convey emotion, but normally I like to just start coding and see what happens. I feel like colors are really important for this assignment because emotions are highly connected with colors, so I might add a reading about how to properly use color. Also, it might be good to talk about the different ways that color is represented in code (RGB, HSB, Hex code). Personally, I like to use hex code or HSB for my colors and palettes.

The hardest compositions for me were the ones where I could only use 100 circles or lines. I felt like there wasn't enough detail in them to get something interesting. Normally I also like to add some kind of texture to my compositions, but I figured that since it's a week 2 assignment, it wouldn't be necessary. Overall, I think it's a fun and relatively easy assignment! Also, it might be fun to try and guess what the emotions are in class.
